# Project1 - Cross Market Analysis
This project is an interactive data analytics dashboard built using:
🐍 Python
🗄 MySQL
📊 Pandas
🌐 Streamlit
The goal of the project was to analyze relationships between cryptocurrency markets, traditional stock indices like the S&P 500, NASDAQ, and NIFTY, and commodities like crude oil.
The dashboard enables users to perform dynamic trend analysis, price comparison, and correlation analysis across multiple financial assets.
data was structured using mysql - python connection across multiple tables - crypto prices, stock prices, and oil prices. 
Pandas were used to calculate metrics such as yearly averages, volatility using standard deviation, percentage price changes, and Pearson correlation to measure how strongly Bitcoin or Ethereum moves relative to stock indices or oil prices. An interactive Streamlit dashboard with multi-page navigation was built. Users can select queries dynamically from a dropdown, apply date filters, visualize trends using line charts, and automatically compute correlation when applicable.
